# COVID Detection using Radiography Data and DL
To explore X-ray images as doctors frequently use X-rays and CT scans to diagnose pneumonia, lung inflammation, abscesses, and/or enlarged lymph nodes.

Since COVID-19 attacks the epithelial cells that line our respiratory tract, we can use X-rays to analyze the health of a patientâ€™s lungs.

## Goal
To Detect and Classify COVID using, CNN or ANN; as an asset of Deep Learning.

# Dataset Information

The dataset contains multiple folders and files: COVID and Normal which contains 13808 Chest X-Ray Images.
